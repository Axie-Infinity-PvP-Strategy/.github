## 🔥 What is Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity is a strategy game where players collect, battle, and breed fantasy creatures called Axies. Built on the Ronin blockchain, players earn tokens like SLP and AXS through PvP and PvE activities in Origins. Each Axie has unique abilities based on genetics, class, and body parts.

You can buy, rent, or breed Axies and compete in daily tournaments and seasonal leaderboards for real token rewards.
